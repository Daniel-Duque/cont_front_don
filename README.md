We developed a model to predict overcost in Colombias and paraguay contracts, the actual architecture of the models can be found here https://github.com/ofiscal/contract-transparency---copia and the weights of the models can be provided if asked at this account. We depend on the libraries that can be found in requirements.txt and package-list-neural.txt, all credits from their respective authors on their models and utilities. We implement the pipeline of data, the header model to predict price and the streamlit implementation. The working paper is being worked... on.
